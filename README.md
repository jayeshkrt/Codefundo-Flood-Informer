# Codefundo-IOT-based-Flood-Informer
A project for warning and monitoring flood water levels in various parts of the disaster affected location.

Floods are the most common natural disasters occuring in India. Various parts of India are seen to be aggravated with floods which are very common yet dreadful in various states of the country.
Recent flood disasters in Kerela, Odisha, Uttarakhand etc. have shown us how grave the situations can turn due to floods.
The most common cause of loss of lives is because of the absence of information to the local people. The water level rises abruptly , mostly during night, and the people remain sleeping without being aware of the rising water level. When they wake up, they are helpless as water flogs everywhere around them. Sometimes, people also drown due to absence of information of the abrupt increase in the water level.

Many lives can be saved if the people get the information that the water level is rising around them and they are going to get affected by flood.

A state of the art technology using IOT can be used to closely monitor and warn the local people of the rising levels of flood water. Informing them about the areas where to migrate will help them tremendously as they won't be heading to the already flood affected area.

An IOT device installed at various public landmarks can help to rescue large number of people at once.

My idea is to create such an IOT device which will help to save lives by warning the locals at the right time, informing about the increasing water levels in the area. Also, informing about the places where they should move so they can get relief from flood, instead of getting caught to other flood prone area.
